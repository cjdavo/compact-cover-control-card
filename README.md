## Usage Examples

### Minimal Configuration

```yaml

rooms:
  - name: Living Room
    covers:
      - name: Window
        entity: cover.living_room_window
```

```yaml
type: custom:compact-cover-control-card
title: House Blinds
invert_percentage: true
middle_position: 70
rooms:
  - name: Living Room
    middle_position: 60
    covers:
      - name: Main Window
        entity: cover.living_room_main
        lock_entity: binary_sensor.living_room_window_open
        middle_position: 50
      - name: Side Window
        entity: cover.living_room_side
        lock_entity: binary_sensor.weather_protection
  - name: Bedroom
    covers:

        entity: cover.bedroom_left
      - name: Window Right
        entity: cover.bedroom_right
```

## Special Features

### KNX Integration
The `invert_percentage` option is particularly useful for KNX installations where the cover percentage is inverted compared to Home Assistant's standard (in KNX, 0% typically means fully open, while in Home Assistant 0% means fully closed). Enable this option to match your KNX cover behavior while maintaining an intuitive user interface.

### Lock Functionality
The `lock_entity` option allows you to disable cover controls based on the state of another entity. This is useful for:
- Weather protection (disable controls during high winds)
- Safety interlocks (prevent operation when windows are open)
- Child safety (disable specific covers when needed)
- Maintenance mode

The cover controls will be disabled when the lock entity state is 'on'.

### Position Control
- Room-level quick actions (‚òÄÔ∏è, ‚õÖ, üåô) control all covers in the room
- Individual sliders provide fine-grained control
- Middle position (‚õÖ) is customizable at card, room, or cover level
- Visual gradient indicates current position with blue (closed) to yellow (open) transition
